# This file specifies a mapping between virtual packages and real packages
# available in the source packages collection (srcpkgs).
#
# The format uses 2 arguments delimited by a blank: <vpkgname> <realpkgname>
#
# If a source package depends on a virtual package (<vpkgname>) and there's
# a replacement defined in that file, <realpkgname> will be used to resolve
# the dependency instead.
#
# - Create your own etc/virtual file to override these defaults.
